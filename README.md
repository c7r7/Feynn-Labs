# What is market segmentation?
At its core, market segmentation is the practice of dividing your target market into approachable groups. Market segmentation creates subsets of a market based on demographics, needs, priorities, common interests, and other psychographic or behavioral criteria used to better understand the target audience.

# 3 segements are extracted fitting the data well
3 segements are made on basis age, like, visiting frequency

Segment 1 - Age group is between 15-35, liking rate is 2.88, Visiting frequency is one a month (average)

Segment 2 - Age group is between 36-54, liking rate is 2.37 , Visiting frequency is one in 2 months (average)

Segment 3 - Age group is between 55-70, liking rate is 1.33, Visiting frequency is one in 3 months (average)

# Outcomes
In the given dataset we have an 15 features out of that we are assumed that 'Like' as an target feature
After the preprocessing and cleaning the data ( such as applying label encoding and replacing some
of the negative values ) . We have moved further to an clustering part of how to group customers
based on their feedback. As we can see that the features yummy and tasty are more contributing to
the ‘Like’ output. And if it is disgusting then more people are giving negative feedback. And gender
has negative correlation. So it cannot plays a major role and it is not the deciding factor.
when we are marketing from next time we make sure that these features yummy, tasty, healthy,
convenient are required for better sales.

> After the market segmentation analysis is completed, and all strategic and tactical marketing
activities have been undertaken, the success of the market segmentation strategy has to be
evaluated, and the market must be carefully monitored on a continuous basis. Changes can
occur within existing market segments. But changes can also occur in the larger
marketplace, for example, if new competitors enter the market. All potential sources of
change have to be monitored in order to detect changes which require McDonald’s
management to adjust their strategic or tactical marketing in view of new market
circumstances
